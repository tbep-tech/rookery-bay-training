# Rookery Bay R Training

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language for statistical computing as well as a general purpose programming language. R has become one of the primary languages used in data science and for data analysis across many of the natural sciences. This training workshop will provide attendees with the foundations for continued learning of R and for analysis of a range of data types. 

## Course objectives

This course is designed to expose you to the fundamentals of using R for reproducible data analysis workflows.  A specific focus will be on using monitoring data from the [NERRS CDMO](https://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/) for novel analyses and storytelling to increase the impact of these valuable sources of information. You will not be experts by the end of the course, but you will have a solid foundation for continued learning.  By the end of this course you will be able to or have the resources to find out how to:

* Use R to import and organize data
* Create plots using R packages for exploratory data analysis
* Create maps in R to explore spatial patterns

## Agenda

* __9:30 - 10:45__ The what, why, and how of R
  
  BREAK
  
* __11:00-12:00__ Data wrangling and plotting

  LUNCH
  
* __1:00 - 2:30__ Working with CDMO data

  BREAK
  
* __2:45 - 4:00__ Spatial data analysis in R

## Software requirements

All required software will be pre-installed on computers provided by the training venue.  You are not required to bring your own laptop.  If you prefer to bring your own laptop, please have a current version of RStudio and R installed. The [setup instructions](setup.html) will guide you through the installation the process.  Take note of the required R packages that you must also download and install.  Please contact the instructor with any questions or issues related to setup.
